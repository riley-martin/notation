# Design for notation
## Frontend
Notation uses a tui/cli frontend.
Notes can be added/removed on the command line and
edited with the editor set in $EDITOR
**WIP**: Currently can only create new notes

## Backend
Notes are saved in markdown files. They are organized in directories by date:
`<year>/<month>/<day>/<hr>.<min>.md`
